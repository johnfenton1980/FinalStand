Final Stand
=============

Welcome to the Final Stand source code!

With the code in this repository, you can build a MMO with Unreal Editor for Windows, Mac, and Linux; compile for a variety of target platforms, including desktop, consoles, mobile, and embedded devices (you will need to add support for platforms yourself, this project only includes linux and windows);
The backend of this project is powered by [OWS](https://github.com/johnfenton1980/OWS2) 

Clone / Fork this repository while it is public. After a undecided period we will switch to private, where invites for access will be required. It will remain public during the basic setup, which is a basis for anyone to start a project with openly available information, inc youtube tutorials. Once private, that is when we'll start to impliment our own code for final stand 

Contributions and ideas welcome. All Contributers will get acess to the private repository once we switch

Open World Server (OWS) is a server instance manager designed to create large worlds in Unreal. Either by stitching together multiple maps or by splitting a single large map into multiple zones, OWS will spin up and shut down server instances as needed based on your world population. OWS can load balance your world across multiple hardware devices. OWS can support thousands of players in the same world by instancing up and out. A single zone can be instanced multiple times to support a large population in one area. Areas of a map can also be split up into multiple zones to support a larger population. In addition to server instance management, OWS also handles persistence for Accounts, Characters, Abilities, Inventory and more.
